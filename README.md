Jovian Hunters is an adventure based sci-fi text game. In the game, biohackers have developed monsters that take over (hijack) different parts of the world. The locations of the monsters are hidden and exploration of each location works as different levels with increasing difficulty. The motive of the game is for a player to choose a character and go on the quest to find different monsters and defeat them in a battle to find other monsters. The last ultimate monster holds the diamond Kohinoor that has the powers to restore peace in the world (Victory). The player goes on an exploration to find these locations to ultimately find the monsters and defeat them, until then the player encounters multiple scenarios where the player can make choices to upgrade his inventory and health in order to prepare and fight the monster.
